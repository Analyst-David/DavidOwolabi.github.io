  <h1>Road Accidents Dashboard Summary</h1>

  <p>
    The Road Accidents Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of accident data, 
    highlighting key metrics such as casualties, accident causes, and road conditions. 
    This enables stakeholders to identify high-risk areas and implement effective safety measures.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Insights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Total Casualties:</strong> 417,883 recorded, including:
      <ul>
        <li>7,135 Fatal Casualties</li>
        <li>59,312 Serious Casualties</li>
        <li>351,436 Slight Casualties</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Vehicle Types:</strong> Cars accounted for the majority of casualties (333,485), 
        followed by motorcycles (33,672) and vans (33,472).</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly Trends:</strong> Accident numbers were relatively consistent 
        across months, with slight increases observed toward year-end.</li>
    <li><strong>Road Type:</strong> Most casualties occurred on single carriageways (309.7K), 
        followed by dual carriageways (67.4K).</li>
    <li><strong>Road Surface:</strong> Majority of accidents occurred on dry roads, 
        with fewer cases on wet or snow/ice surfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Urban areas had higher casualties (255,864) compared to rural areas (162,019).</li>
    <li><strong>Light Conditions:</strong> Most accidents happened during the day (304,963) 
        compared to night (112,920).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The dashboard reveals that cars are the most involved in accidents, with urban areas 
    and daytime conditions contributing to higher casualty counts. 
    Single carriageways remain the most dangerous road type. 
    These insights can help policymakers, law enforcement, and transport agencies 
    develop targeted strategies to improve road safety and reduce casualties.

<section id="recommendations">
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Focus on Urban Safety:</strong> Since urban areas have more casualties than rural areas, road safety interventions should prioritize cities and busy intersections.</li>
        <li><strong>Target High-Risk Vehicles:</strong> Cars make up the majority of accident casualties (â‰ˆ80%). Campaigns, stricter traffic enforcement, and improved driver training should be directed at private car users.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve Nighttime Road Safety:</strong> Most accidents happen at night. Improving street lighting, stricter checks on drunk driving, and nighttime patrols can help reduce accidents.</li>
        <li><strong>Address Hazardous Road Types:</strong> Single carriageways have the highest accident rate. Authorities should consider redesigning them with safety measures such as barriers, wider lanes, and speed control.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather-Specific Interventions:</strong> Though fewer, accidents on wet and icy roads are often severe. Installing better drainage and anti-skid surfaces can reduce weather-related casualties.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal/Trend Monitoring:</strong> The dashboard shows monthly trends. Authorities should strengthen traffic enforcement during months with higher spikes in accidents.</li>
    </ul>
